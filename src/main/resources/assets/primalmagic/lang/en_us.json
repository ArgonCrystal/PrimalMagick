    "primalmagic.research.first_steps.title": "First Steps",
    "primalmagic.research.first_steps.text.stage.1": "What an incredible book!  While largely blank, it seems to contain more pages than could conceivably fit in its slim binding.  Plus, it generates its own updating index as I write in it.  This will make a perfect volume in which to record my progress in magical studies.<BR>Note, however, that I said, 'largely blank'.  Sometimes when I flip randomly through its pages, I find one covered in strange notes and diagrams, a page that seems to disappear once I turn past it.  I can't understand most of their contents, but I can eke out a few hints of how to proceed in my studies, like a trail of breadcrumbs leading me to vast knowledge.<BR>So far, the first thing I've learned that the strange dust I found under the shrine is called Essence, and that it's a physical manifestation of magical energy, called Mana.  The magical arts rely heavily on Essence and Mana, so I should be prepared to seek out as much as I can.<BR>The second thing I've learned, after much frustration, is that magical crafting requires techniques, and frequently infusions of Mana, that are beyond the capacity of a normal crafting table.  I'll need to devise a new type of workbench if I'm to progress further, but curiously the Grimoire gives no suggestion as to how I might do that.  Perhaps it's a test, of sorts.<BR>I wonder...  Waving a wand at a bookshelf was enough to get me this Grimoire.  Maybe waving it at a crafting table will get me what I need a second time?",
    "primalmagic.research.first_steps.text.stage.2": "Wow, that actually worked.  I now have access to an Arcane Workbench sufficient for my magical crafting needs.<BR>Now I just need some mana for my wand, but how to get it?  Maybe the shrines hold the answer.  I should visit one again with my wand in hand.<BR>Whatever I do, I should be prepared to harvest more mana than I think I'll need, as the Grimoire indicates that a mundane wand like this is an inefficient conducter of it.",
    "primalmagic.research.first_steps.text.stage.3": "I've now got some mana and an arcane workbench with which to use it.  Now the question is what to do with them.<BR>The notes that I find in the grimoire make mention of five primal sources of magic: the Earth, the Sea, the Sky, the Sun, and the Moon.  It also hints that everything in the world, down to the smallest pebble, has an affinity to one or more of these sources.  That seems worth investigating, but I'll need better tools.<BR>It shouldn't take much to get me started.  A sturdy wooden table to work at, a magnifying glass to more closely study objects, and some paper on which to record my findings.  Yes, that'll do for now.<BR>Once I get that all set up, I can start analyzing things.  I expect that the analysis process will have to be quite thorough for me to learn anything, though.<BR>It would probably be best to hold off on analyzing anything truly valuable, as the item will undoubtedly be lost beyond repair after I'm done with it.  Still, studying a few items like this should give me the information I need to start pursuing more advanced knowledge.",
    "primalmagic.research.first_steps.text.stage.4": "Okay, I've made some useful observations.  These will prove foundational as I continue to study the rudiments of magic.  I should make a point to analyze everything I come across.  Just one of each type, though.  I won't learn anything new from studying the same type of object twice.<BR>Usefully, I've also formed a detailed analysis of the magical affinities of the objects I've studied.  Granted, I'm not sure what to do with this information yet, but I'm certain it will prove valuable down the road.  I can remind myself of the affinities of any type of object I've studied by holding SHIFT while hovering over the item in my inventory.",
    
    "primalmagic.research.theorycrafting.title": "Theorycrafting",
    "primalmagic.research.theorycrafting.text.stage.1": "To paraphrase a wise philosopher, if I've learned anything so far, it's that I know nothing.  Rudimentary observations on the magical world may suffice for studying the basics of magic, but they won't be enough to broach the advanced topics.  For that I'm going to need to form some Theories of my own.<BR>I should give some thought to how best to accomplish this, based on what I've learned so far.",
    "primalmagic.research.theorycrafting.text.stage.2": "Okay, I think I've got this figured out.  I'm going to need to set up a dedicated space for my research work, and I'm going to need writing materials.  Lots of paper, and special enchanted ink.",
    "primalmagic.research.theorycrafting.text.stage.3": "My research table is in place, so it's time to get to work.<BR>Once I place some writing materials on my research table, I'll be able to start on the first research project that comes to mind.  Projects come in many different shapes and sizes, but they all require materials for the best chance of success.  The materials needed for a project will be listed at the bottom of its card.<BR>Sometimes the material will be consumed as part of completing the project.  If this is the case, it will be marked with an exclamation point.  For those without an exclamation point, I simply need to have the material on hand; it won't be lost.<BR>If the material is a block and it's not slated to be consumed by the project, then I don't even need to have it on my person.  Simply having the block placed near the research table, within five blocks, will be good enough.<BR>The current success chance of the project is listed on its completion button.  Selecting materials to use for the project will increase my chances of success.  Should the project be a success, I'll make progress towards forming a Theory.  If it fails, I'll gain nothing.<BR>Having one or more research aids within five blocks of my research table might also be a good idea, but it's not mandatory.  Research aids will unlock special research projects that are easier to complete and make more Theory progress.  My analysis table would be a good start.  There may be other blocks that make good research aids, but I'll have to experiment to find out what they are.",
    "primalmagic.research.theorycrafting.text.stage.4": "I've formed my first theory!  This will definitely prove useful later in my studies.<BR>I should expect research projects to become more difficult as I exhaust the low-hanging fruit.  They'll probably have lower starting success chances and require more research materials the more projects I complete.  This will only make bonus projects unlocked by research aids more economical, so I should definitely try to identify as many of them as I can.<BR>Remember, self: the research table only detects blocks within five blocks of itself.  Try an analysis table as a starting research aid.",

    "primalmagic.research.attunements.text.stage.2": "Fascinating.  From what I can tell, the study and use of magic brings a person more into alignment with that source of magic, body and mind.  This results in the development of incredible new abilities on the part of the attuned mage.<BR>Learning a new spell or recipe in my Grimoire will sometimes permanently increase my attunement to the relevant source; I'll be sure to note in the grimoire when this happens.  In addition, channeling mana, whether by crafting a recipe or casting a spell, will temporarily increase my attunement to that source.  The effect can be significant, but it will slowly decay over time.<BR>I've cast a simple spell on my Grimoire to track my current attunement levels.  Should I ever wish to check them, or to remind myself what attunement to a particular source will gain me, I need only check the Attunements section under Other Topics in the main index.",

Regardless, the crucible provides its own heat and slowly fills itself with... let's just call it fluid; it doesn't bear to give that too much thought.<BR>The crucible is capable of spawning almost any kind of life I can imagine, at a price.  Configuring the crucible so that it knows what to spawn requires a Sanguine Core; I know how to make a blank one now, but attuning one to a specific creature type will require more research.<BR>In addition, animating that spawned life requires souls in the form of soul gems.  Thankfully, I already know the spell to acquire those.<BR>Once I have an attuned Sanguine Core and the necessary amount of soul gems, I will need to use the core on the crucible to slot it in place, and then throw the gems into the bubbling fluid.  A few seconds later, I'll be face to face with a spawned creature to do with as I see fit.",

I suspect I'll also be able to select ways to modify the spell once I learn more, but for now that's it.<BR>Once the characteristics of the spell are settled, I will have to take a wand, place it on the altar, and use it to spend mana to scribe the spell onto a scroll.<BR>I suspect there are a wide variety of types of spells I'll be able to cast with more experience, so I'd better get practicing!",

Then you stage everything in the right place.  And then you follow each step exactly as written at the appointed time.<BR>There's just a slightly higher chance of something exploding if you do it wrong.<BR>I need several things in order to conduct a ritual.  First and most important is the central altar.  This serves as the focal point of the ritual, around which everything else is arrayed, both physically and metaphysically.<BR>Next come the offering pedestals, arrayed around the altar.  It's on these that I place the ingredients for the ritual.  Having more pedestals than I need doesn't hurt, but they might get a little in the way.<BR>Thirdly, all rituals require props of some kind, placed near the altar.  I'll come back to these in a bit.<BR>Finally, I need refined salt, and lots of it.  Every block that's part of the ritual, be it a prop or an offering pedestal, must be connected to the central altar by an unbroken line of salt.  No salt, no mystical connection, bad times.<BR>To start a ritual, I must first identify what ingredients and props it needs.  These will be listed in the Grimoire entry for each ritual.  Once identified, I array the pedestals and props around the altar, ensuring a salt connection.  Symmetry is important in this placement, and will contribute to a successful ritual.  I then place each of the ingredients on a separate pedestal and, once I'm ready to begin, wave my wand at the central altar.<BR>Once started, an orb of energy will appear above the altar.  This orb is a sort of status indicator for the ritual's stability.<BR>Right, stability.<BR>Ritual magic is dangerous, and rituals destabilize the longer they go on.  Too much instability buildup, and mishaps can happen.  That's bad, potentially disastrous.  The more red that orb over the altar is, the more unstable the ritual has become.  On the other hand, if it turns green, that means I'm doing a good job keeping the instability in check.  All rituals will destabilize over time proportionately to their instability rating, but other things can affect it as well.  The symmetry that I mentioned earlier?  Asymmetrical ritual setups will destabilize faster.  Using too much salt will also cause destabilization, as it grounds out the magic.<BR>Anyway, as the ritual progresses, the central altar will absorb the offerings I've placed on the pedestals.  At certain points, though, the ritual will pause and demand that I interact with one of the ritual's props.  This is the most dangerous time in a ritual, as instability will be mounting while no progress is being made.  Once the prop interaction is complete, the ritual will resume progress, with an added burst of stability.  Precisely how I need to interact with a prop will be detailed in its Grimoire entry.<BR>Once all of the offerings have been absorbed and all of the props have been interacted with, the ritual will end and the end result will appear on the central altar for me to claim.<BR>Should I feel at any point that a ritual is spiraling beyond my control, I can abort the ritual by waving my wand at the altar a second time.  This may have consequences, depending on the built-up instability, but that's better than letting it continue indefinitely.",
